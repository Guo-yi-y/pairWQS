Installing Python and Required packages on Windows

##1. Download and Install python
Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ and download the “Windows installer (64-bit)”.

Run the installer, check “Add python.exe to PATH,” and then click Install Now.

##2. Link R to Python
##2.1 Open RStudio and run:
``` r
#install.packages("reticulate") # Skip if reticulate is already installed

Sys.which("python")
```
Copy the path that Sys.which("python") prints (see the first screenshot)
![Path of python](imag1.png)

##2.2 Run:
``` r
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```
This code will open .Renviron. In the .Renviron file that opens, paste a line like the following (replacing the path with the one you copied):
![Edit .Renviron](imag2.png)

2.3 Save the file and restart R.


3. Install python packages from R
``` r
library(reticulate)
py_install(c("numpy", "scipy", "numba"), pip = TRUE)
```
Running these commands installs NumPy, SciPy, and Numba into the Python interpreter that R now recognizes.
