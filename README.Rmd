# pairWQS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pairWQS is to perform WQS analysis for design with paired data structure, such as case-control and case-crossover study

## Installation

You can install the development version of pairWQS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Guo-yi-y/pairWQS")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(pairWQS)
result <- pairwqs(
  train_data = train_data,
  valid_data = valid_data,
  col_vars = col_vars,
  col_covars = NULL,
  id = "studyid", 
  event = "event", 
  q=4, 
  boot = FALSE
)
```

In environmental study, researchers usually to adjust the spline terms of temperature and humidity. For example, you may want to adjust ns(temp, 3) and ns(hum, 3), then you can perform:

``` r
train_data = cbind(train_data, ns(train_data$temp, 3), ns(train_data$hum, 3))

names(train_data)[ (ncol(train_data)-5):ncol(train_data)] = c("ns_temp1", "ns_temp2", "ns_temp3", "ns_h1", "ns_h2", "ns_h3")
result <- pairwqs(
  train_data = train_data,
  valid_data = valid_data,
  col_vars = col_vars,
  col_covars = c("ns_temp1", "ns_temp2", "ns_temp3", "ns_h1", "ns_h2", "ns_h3"),
  id = "studyid", 
  event = "event", 
  q=4, 
  boot = FALSE
)
```
